# Amazon_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
Data and Sentiment analysis of amazon reviews.

This is my first Data analysis and machine learning project that uses nltk,pandas,matplotlib.
Here we categorize the reviews by performing sentiment analysis on them.
The SentimentInetensityAnalyzer function in nltk will give us the probabilties of any particular review being positive, negative or neutral.
It will also give us analysis of review sentiment to rating graphs.
